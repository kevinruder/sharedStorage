# sharedStorage
sharedStorage is a platform where people can rent out any storage space they might have available.
The platform was built using Meteor.
Meteor is a full stack framework and illustrates my capabilities within frontend and backend programming along with DB querrying in MongoDB.

A video showing its usage can be seen here.

The concept is explained in more detail in my portfolio.
